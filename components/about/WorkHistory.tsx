        Since 2019, I have been working as a consultant in a call center. My
        responsibilities include extending contracts with clients of the largest
        satellite television provider in Poland and upselling telecommunication
        services.

        Additionally, from November 2022 to January 2023, I participated in an
        internship program at Itransition. During my time there, I worked on
        assigned tasks focused on building a full-stack application using React,
        Express.js, and MySQL.
