        I have strong front-end development skills, including expertise in HTML,
        CSS, CSS modules, SCSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I am experienced
        in creating responsive and user-friendly web pages using these
        technologies.

        Recently, I have started to expand my knowledge into back-end
        development, with a particular focus on Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL
        database. Also I am familiar with creating and consuming RESTful APIs.
      </p>

        Overall, I have a strong understanding of web development principles and
        best practices, including the use of version control systems like Git. I
        have excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, and I am always
        looking for ways to improve my work.
